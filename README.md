#Express Middleware
Middleware functions are functions that have access to the request object (req), the response object (res), and the next function in the application’s request-response cycle. The next function is a function in the Express router which, when invoked, executes the middleware succeeding the current middleware.

Middleware functions can perform the following tasks:

    1. Execute any code.
    2. Make changes to the request and the response objects.
    3. End the request-response cycle.
    4. Call the next middleware in the stack.

#Using middleware

Express is a routing and middleware web framework that has minimal functionality of its own: An Express application is essentially a series of middleware function calls.

Middleware functions are functions that have access to the request object (req), the response object (res), and the next middleware function in the application’s request-response cycle. The next middleware function is commonly denoted by a variable named next.

Middleware functions can perform the following tasks:

    Execute any code.
    Make changes to the request and the response objects.
    End the request-response cycle.
    Call the next middleware function in the stack.

If the current middleware function does not end the request-response cycle, it must call next() to pass control to the next middleware function. Otherwise, the request will be left hanging.

An Express application can use the following types of middleware:

    Application-level middleware
    Router-level middleware
    Error-handling middleware
    Built-in middleware
    Third-party middleware
